# Explanation
I created this application as my capstone for the Bloc curriculum.  This was a great experience for me to come up with an idea, generate user stores, wireframe user interfaces, and create an application from scratch in Ruby on Rails.  Over time I hope to add new functionalities to this app as it is my pet project.
